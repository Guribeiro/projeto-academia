                  You probably think that you are better now, better now
                  You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
                  You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
                  Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
                  You know I say that I am better now, better now

                  I did not believe that it would end, no
                  Everything came second to the Benzo
                  You're not even speaking to my friends, no
                  You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
                  Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
                  We were looking forward to the rest of our lives
                  Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
                  Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
                  And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
                  With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
                  Drinkin' Henney and I'm tryna forget
                  But I can't get this shit outta my head

                  I seen you with your other dude
                  He seemed like he was pretty cool
                  I was so broken over you
                  Life, it goes on, what can you do?
                  I just wonder what it's gonna take (what's it gonna take?)
                  Another foreign or a bigger chain (bigger chain)
                  Because no matter how my life has changed (matter how my life has changed)
                  I keep on looking back on better days

                  Had to have high, high hopes for a living
                  Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
                  Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
